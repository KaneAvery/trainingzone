  <p><h1>History of Training Zone</h1>
  Training Zone has been the in IT & Management in Plongk St, Cairnsville for the last 150 years. The founder of the company, Touglas Zonas is still CEO and spokesperson for Training Zone. 
  <br><br>Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous Lecture Clash  training:
 <br><br> Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: 
  <br><ul>•	Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. </ul>
  <ul>•	Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). </ul>
  <ul>•	Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. </ul>
  Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are: 
  <ul>o	If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. </ul>
  <ul>o	Which one are you most on top of? </ul>
  <ul>o	Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? </ul>
  <ul>•	Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.</ul>
